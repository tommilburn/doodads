# noise

Pleasant background noise that stops if you unplug the interface it's connected
to. I frequently forgot to pause my music before unplugging my computer and the
connected sound card, which sure is an embarassing open office faux paus.

This polls for the connected sound card, and kills the noise if it's not found.
